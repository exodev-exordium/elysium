# Elysium

*A project by the Exordium Development Team.*

Elysium is a customized chromium browser, created using `electronjs` and `nodejs`. Our object is to integrate our [Exordium](https://github.com/exordium-dev/exordium) project with this one, implmenting the use of a free virtual private networking system that allows users, even those that can't afford a subscription to remain safe and keep their data private.

This project is only in the early stages of development, images and documentation will be added over time as we continue to add to this project.
